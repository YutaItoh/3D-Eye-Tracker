# 3D Eye Tracker

This software aims to provide an easy-to-compile C++ implementation of a 3D eye-tracking method.

Our software is designed for a wearable eye-tracking scnenario where a user wears a headset with an eye camera(s) that is equipped with infrared (IR) illuminations. The camera can capture close-up shots of the user's eyes.

If you need a near-eye IR camera, instructions for building your for under $100 can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lZqCMRMtC8

With this software, you can obtain the following information:

* 3D information:
  * Gaze (normal) vector
  * Eyeball center w.r.t the camera
  * Pupil diameter [m]
* 2D information:
  * Pupil ellipse size [pixel] and angle [deg.]
  * (Glint position(s) [pixel], to be merged soon...)

## Prerequisite

Currently, the software is compatible with Visual Studio 2015. The test was done on a 64bit Windows 10 machine only.

Most of external libraries (for vc14, x64) are bundled in `./external`, yet you still need to 
install the following two libraries:
* [OpenCV 3.1](http://opencv.org/downloads.html) 
  * We recommend to use [***a windows installer***](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/3.1.0/opencv-3.1.0.exe/download) (vc14, x64)
* [Boost C++ Libraries ver. >1.62](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.62.0/)
  * We recommend to use [***a windows installer***](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.62.0/boost_1_62_0-msvc-14.0-64.exe/download) (boost_1_62_0-msvc-14.0-64.exe)

To setup your own Visual Studio project, you need to use [CMake](https://cmake.org/). You can find a windows installer [here](https://cmake.org/download/).
 
## How to compile

1. Clone the repository `git@github.com:YutaItoh/3D-Eye-Tracker.git` to your local folder (e.g., `/your-local-path/3D-Eye-Tracker`)
2. Open `./CMakeLists.txt` and edit the OpenCV path and the Boost path depending on your environment. For example, the default values are as follows:
   * `set(BOOST_ROOT "C:/SDK/boost_1_62_0")`
   * `set(OpenCV_DIR "C:/SDK/opencv-3.1.0/build")`
3. Start CMake GUI and set a source code path (e.g., `/your-local-path/3D-Eye-Tracker`) and a project build path (e.g., `/your-local-path/3D-Eye-Tracker/build_vc14_x64`)

4. Press `Generate` buttons, then choose a right build environment (Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64)

5. Open `3d_eye_tracker.sln` in the build folder, and compile `main` project (recommend to set it as a startup project)

## How to run

The default setting uses a sinlge camera via the DirectShow filter. Check your camera name on a video capture program (e.g., Skype) and set the name in `main.cpp`:
``` c++
		case InputMode::CAMERA_MONO:
			eyecams[0]=std::make_unique<eyecamera::EyeCameraDS>("Pupil Cam1 ID0");
```
In this case, the program tries to find a camera named `"Pupil Cam1 ID0"`.

Once the program started, it initializes a 3D eye model from 2D pupil observatios:

In this initialization step, a user needs to smoothly rotate his/her eye to capture various 2D shapes of the eye.

After the step, we get 3D eye tracking:

### Tips:

Some debug keys are pre-assigned for a better control of the software:
* `p`: Takes some more 2D pupil observations. Useful when estimated 3D eye model is incorrect due to not-well-distributed 2D observations
* `r`: Resets the 3D eye model and 2D observations and restarts the initialization step
* `ESC`: Exit the program
